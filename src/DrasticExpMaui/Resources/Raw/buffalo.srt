Bar Pizza! You know the concept is nothing new but when the peeps over at good old B-dubs do it their way guys you already know

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,740
So stay tuned because up next I've got the all-new honey barbecue boneless bar pizza on tap

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,200
All right, let me pick up one of these pieces here and wow, this is very nice cut very beautifully

00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,260
It's the honey barbecue boneless bar pizza here at Buffalo Wild Wings. Let's peep this out

00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,280
Mmm

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,740
Sweet we're right off the break outside of the sweetness

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,760
I'm kind of getting a focaccia vibe with this one guys almost like a flatbread type of situation

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,700
I wouldn't say pizza necessarily, but again, it's not really a traditional pizza in that sense. Let's keep going in

00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,040
Hot pickled peppers there it is. Oh

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,160
Little steamy
